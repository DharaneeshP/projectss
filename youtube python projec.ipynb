       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days. So now it's on you\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n\\nTo Shop on Amazon & Flipkart:\\nAmazon : https://amzn.to/2H5y5Z2\\nFlipkart  : http://fkrt.it/5ZmjeLuuuN\",\n",

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively.

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games.

       "  'Description': '#PocoF5 #TechBoss #Poco\\n\\nPoco F5 --- 8GB + 256GB - ₹29,999 \\nPoco F5 --- 12GB + 256GB - ₹34,990\\n\\nPOCO F5 5G Flagship Killer Is Here\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a simple yet commercial format aligning with its design. Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days. So now it's on you\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n\\nTo Shop on Amazon & Flipkart:\\nAmazon : https://amzn.to/2H5y5Z2\\nFlipkart  : http://fkrt.it/5ZmjeLuuuN\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#PocoF5 #TechBoss #Poco\\n\\nPoco F5 --- 8GB + 256GB - ₹29,999 \\nPoco F5 --- 12GB + 256GB - ₹34,990\\n\\nPOCO F5 5G Flagship Killer Is Here\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a simple yet commercial format aligning with its design. Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level.

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days. So now it's on you\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n\\nTo Shop on Amazon & Flipkart:\\nAmazon : https://amzn.to/2H5y5Z2\\nFlipkart  : http://fkrt.it/5ZmjeLuuuN\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#PocoF5 #TechBoss #Poco\\n\\nPoco F5 --- 8GB + 256GB - ₹29,999 \\nPoco F5 --- 12GB + 256GB - ₹34,990\\n\\nPOCO F5 5G Flagship Killer Is Here\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a simple yet commercial format aligning with its design. Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO.

A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation.

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days. So now it's on you\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n\\nTo Shop on Amazon & Flipkart:\\nAmazon : https://amzn.to/2H5y5Z2\\nFlipkart  : http://fkrt.it/5ZmjeLuuuN\",\n",

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level.

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games.

       "  'Description': '#PocoF5 #TechBoss #Poco\\n\\nPoco F5 --- 8GB + 256GB - ₹29,999 \\nPoco F5 --- 12GB + 256GB - ₹34,990\\n\\nPOCO F5 5G Flagship Killer Is Here\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a simple yet commercial format aligning with its design. Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days. So now it's on you\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n\\nTo Shop on Amazon & Flipkart:\\nAmazon : https://amzn.to/2H5y5Z2\\nFlipkart  : http://fkrt.it/5ZmjeLuuuN\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#PocoF5 #TechBoss #Poco\\n\\nPoco F5 --- 8GB + 256GB - ₹29,999 \\nPoco F5 --- 12GB + 256GB - ₹34,990\\n\\nPOCO F5 5G Flagship Killer Is Here\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a simple yet commercial format aligning with its design. Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level.

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days. So now it's on you\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n\\nTo Shop on Amazon & Flipkart:\\nAmazon : https://amzn.to/2H5y5Z2\\nFlipkart  : http://fkrt.it/5ZmjeLuuuN\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#PocoF5 #TechBoss #Poco\\n\\nPoco F5 --- 8GB + 256GB - ₹29,999 \\nPoco F5 --- 12GB + 256GB - ₹34,990\\n\\nPOCO F5 5G Flagship Killer Is Here\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a simple yet commercial format aligning with its design. Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO.

A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation.

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days. So now it's on you\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n\\nTo Shop on Amazon & Flipkart:\\nAmazon : https://amzn.to/2H5y5Z2\\nFlipkart  : http://fkrt.it/5ZmjeLuuuN\",\n",

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level.

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

Gradually we move to the unboxing section and right from the start looking at the box size we can make out that this lacks a charger. Other than that SIM ejector tool TYPE C TO TYPE C charging cable followed by user manual. Even if this looks like one of the red variants of S22 ultra this one is called dark red same to be Red directly other than this we have green and black variants. The real design is very premium and the camera modules are similar to the S22 Ultra. The texture of the back is really satisfying and slip free. In the orthographic side view this is a box like design. And it weighs 201g. This also runs on the Samsung Exynos 1330 chip in contrast with the A13\\'s 850 this would steal the show. As the Antutu score is beyond 411k whether it\\'s on paper spec or realtime usage, both are satisfying in terms of performance.Focus on 5G vision of Samsung. They are the number one ranking company to offer most 5G patents. Most of the rival brands were offering 1-3 bands in the affordable range but Samsung was the first company to offer 11 bands in an affordable budget range predominantly way back in the year 2021. Samsung was the only brand with the biggest 5G portfolio with a combo of 20 products including smartphones. The main vision of Samsung is that 5G should reach every person on earth. The Samsung galaxy S10 is the world\\'s first 5G phone.  This sports 7 5G  bands totally. Main competitors like Airtel and Jio are targeting rural areas to  kick start 5G. And coincidentally we got this A14 released on the same day when 5G was launched in Madurai. It was really easy for us to test. Hardware wise 4GB RAM 64GB STORAGE, 6GB RAM 128GB STORAGE, 8GB RAM 128GB STORAGE are the available combinations. There is a dedicated memory card slot. Dual 5G sims simultaneously. We can use up to 16 GB RAM collectively using the RAM boost technology. This runs the One UI on Android 13. This offers great customization features in terms of the home screen and lock screen options and also avatars options for contacts. There are few bloatware pre-installed but one can easily sort and Chuck it. Samsung pay mini is also offered which might be of use to you. Privacy and security have improved dramatically. Also Samsung promises 2 years of Android OS upgrade with another 2 versions minimum 4years of security update. Samsung is dominant in terms of updates. We also covered this One UI exclusively. The display is 6.6\" FHD+ 90HZ PLS (10%brighter display compared to contemporary LCD display) LCD screen. The viewing angle and overall experience is really good. The production cost of this panel would be 15% more affordable. Brightness is decent at 480 nits. Bezels are the only points of improvement. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast enough, face unlock is decent too. Other than these 5000Mah batteries with 15 watt fast charging support is great perhaps, having said that we don\\'t get a charger one may have to buy one separately. We would like to suggest that Brands like Samsung should consider the key that Affordable mid rangers like this should get the charger in the box. As this might be one\\'s first ever phone and might turn as an extra bucks spent from the pocket which turns scary for planning something new. 2 days of battery is the backup advertised and single speaker is offered which is decent as well. In this budget range, dual stereo speakers are anticipated. 3.5 mm jack is available and the camera is a 2MP 50MP 2MP combo. Macro, main lens and depth respectively. A 13MP Selfie camera usually Exynos would be good and smooth the quality of photos well optimized. Particularly selfies are improved wisely. Service is this time out of the box from samsung yes this time out of the world local Indian idea with roaming centers as vehicles up to 500 vehicles with 1500 touch points one can have the door step like service experience. We aren\\'t actually sure of the exact price but if this is offered for about ₹15000 with all the features this should turn out to be a great pick',\n",

This phone is a newly released real Indian phone. We see the First and most significant message and assurance. Screen damage cover for 100days from date of purchase. And 24 hour damage cover including free pick-up and drop service. Which we insist every brand to offer for better reliability with belief in quality and durability. These options offer courage to the customer to rely on the brand. Not just that they also offer PAN India service as the confidence boosts better. They also offered glass back in this price range which should inspire the other brands. And a really sleek simple design. Stock Android with no bloatware makes ita a charm to hold in hand. It sports a 6.5 inch IPS lCD HD+ display. This runs on Android 12 it's would be great if there is regular updates as well. Camera setup is a Triple combo with Main lens at 13MP main and 2MP each for Depth and Macro Lens. 8MP lens in Selfie. Photos are Moderate as this is a Simple low budget phone. But battery is 5000Mah with normal charging. But RAM upto 6GB is offered. Internal storage upto 64GB. Face unlock and Fingerprint sensor are fair enough at this price range. Even for gaming its good for Moderate games and Moderate for heavy games. As only dip is Processor is Mediatek A22 processor which is Good for all basic functions but not for heavy apps, games and multi-tasking. We also cover up the service legitimacy with our team trying to service the damaged phone. Service charge only applicable not material cost with in 100days.

Design is refreshing like Freezing cool ice crystal. As cool as cucumber. Contents in the box are papers SIM ejector tool TPU case, 67watts charger, charging cable. Finally the reveal of the phone is the newly launched POCO F5 5G. After POCO F1 the brand claims that this is going to be its successor and has overwhelmed in terms with respect to spec. Firstly it\\'s performance, SG 7+ Gen 2 we haven\\'t witnessed Gen 1. This came in as a Direct debutant performer, into this SOC. The CPU, GPU architecture of this  SOC is similar to that of the 8 Gen 1 chip and even in terms of the AnTuTu score, is very close to 1Million. And in terms of the first impression for general purposes it\\'s buttery smooth. The 2 variants available are 8GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE and 12GB RAM 256 GB STORAGE. If a RAM extension is anticipated, it\\'s available. But the internal ROM expansion is not possible. Even there is no compromise in terms of the technology as UFS 3.1 for ROM with LPDDR5 FOR RAM is offered. With the given SOC, and aforesaid technology we witnessed a good performance in terms of gaming. With no lag or hassle. As usual we tested COD and PubG and it performed really well. Besides we have hyperboost technology to ensure the hardware and software optimisation is intact and the frame rate doesn\\'t drop and stays constant for even a smoother gaming experience. And there is a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna for ensuring uninterrupted gaming experience even during network fluctuation. And this is the first of its kind in this budget range as claimed by the brand. The touch response is even better during gaming. In order to ensure the warming of the phone a large 3725mm² Vapour chamber cooling  system is deployed, with a 14 layer Graphite sheet so mostly we didn\\'t experience warming. Even if we focussed keenly on the screen to body ratio, we couldn\\'t notice much bezels. Hence the full screen experience is really good. But the display specs are a contemporary 6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. This is a 12 but panel with, 1000 NITS peak brightness, HDR10+, Dolby VISION & ADAPTIVE HDR support. It has 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut support. Gorilla Glass 5 protection too. But only the in display fingerprint sensor is missing instead a side mounted fingerprint sensor is in place. I\\'m now under the red hot sun yet the display is very much visible. Rear camera sensors are 3 as contemporary but the rings around it are unique. 64MP OIS main sensor which supports 4k video up to 30fps. The stability factor with the video is really nice and satisfying. Even the quality of photos is crisp and good overall. Besides the main 7 modes are offered namely short video, panorama, VLOG, slow motion, time lapse, AI water mark, long exposure etc. Out of these my favourite pick is the portrait, with really well focussed blue around it makes it a best choice and close to a professional camera. 8MP Ultra wide and 2MP Macro sensor. We would share the samples and all the outputs are decent. Selfie is a 16MP sensor, and photos are good. Other than these, 5000mAh battery, 67w fast charging support which would take up to 45 - 50mins for 0-100%. IP 53 rating is there in place for dust and water splash resistance. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Hence sound is satisfying. And there is a surprise as this phone sports a 3.5 mm jack which is nowadays fascinating in this price range. With this you can have the high resolution audio support with wired headsets or earphones. IR blaster support, Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.3 are offered MIUI 14 over Android 13 is offered. Another added cherry to the cake is the MIUI dialler and also this supports call recording hence one might not be forced to use the Google dialler anymore. So the brand ensures 2 years of software updates that is Android 14 & 15 are anticipated and security updates for the next 3 years are offered and this is the overall spec of the phone. Design, display and performance are top notch. But only based on the price one can decide, yes we aren\\'t sure of it. As we shot in an embargo. We will update the description soon as we know. 25 to 30k would be a competitive price for this phone as we expect. Do let us know in the comments about your views and thoughts about. Let\\'s see in review.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Unboxing Poco F5\\n01:56 Poco F5 Display \\n02:21 Poco F5 Camera \\n03:29 Poco F5 Special Features \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Blaze2_5G #Lordof5G #bestsmartphoneunder10k \\n\\nBest Buy: https://www.lavamobiles.com/smartphones/blaze-2-5g/\\n\\n------\\n\\nSummary for Lava Blaze 2 5G\\n\\nIn this video, we are going to review the Lava Blaze 2 5G, a budget smartphone with some unique features. Unlike most phones in this segment, this is a 5G phone with a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6020 processor. This processor is a rebranded version of the MediaTek Dimensity 700, which we have seen in other phones that cost around Rs. 12,000. The performance of this processor is decent and good for daily tasks, chatting, and browsing. Usually in this segment you can see only eMMC storage in some other brands. This phone has UFS 2.2. This phone comes in two variants 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. You can put an extra memory card up to 1TB. The Lava Blaze 2 5G has an AnTuTu score of more than 3.5 lakhs, which is impressive for a phone that costs only Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of this phone is the ring light around the camera module. This light will blink when you receive a call, when you charge the phone, or when you get notifications from certain apps. This is a cool and stylish feature that no other phone in this segment has. We will then show a small cinematic clip to spice up the video.\\n\\nThe back panel of this phone has a classy black finish that looks premium. The phone has a 6.5-inch HD+ 2.5D curved display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is 450 nits, which is decent for outdoor visibility. We are not sure about the protection of the display, but we will update you as soon as we find out. The phone also comes with a case in the box, which is nice.\\n\\nThe phone has a 50MP main camera and an AI camera on the back. The camera quality is good and the photos are sharp and detailed. The selfie camera is also good and it has a beauty mode that applies a slight makeup to your face. The camera app has a lot of features, such as Pro mode, Gif mode, Panorama mode, and more. These features are not usually available in phones that cost around Rs. 10,000. The phone can also record videos in 2K resolution, which is great.\\n\\nThe phone has a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone does not have any bloatware or extra apps, which is a big plus. The phone has a clean and stock Android 13 OS, which is smooth and fast. The phone does not have any ads, which is another big plus. The phone also gets 2 years of security patch updates, which is rare in this segment.\\n\\nThe phone has a single speaker with Hi-Res audio support. The sound quality is good and loud. The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which is fast and accurate. The phone also has face unlock and auto call recording features. Another interesting feature is that if you place the phone with the back facing you, the phone will go into silent mode automatically. This is a handy feature for meetings or classes. The phone also has its own dialer app, which is simple and easy to use.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this phone is the service that Lava provides. Lava offers free service at your home itself, which is amazing. You don’t have to go to any service center or wait for long. Lava will come to your doorstep and fix your phone for free. This is something that Lava does for all its phones and we really appreciate it. This service is also available for this phone.\\n\\nThe price of this phone is Rs. 9,999, which is very affordable and reasonable. If we compare this phone with other brands, we can see that this phone has a lot of advantages, such as a good processor, a clean UI, no ads, no bloatware, and a superb service. This phone also has some unique features, such as the ring light, the silent mode, and the 2K video recording. This phone is also an Indian brand, which makes us proud\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro & Unboxing \\n00:26 Lava Blaze 2 5G Processor \\n01:22 Lava Blaze 2 5G Special Features \\n01:45 Lava Blaze 2 5G Design \\n01:57 Lava Blaze 2 5G Display \\n02:34 Lava Blaze 2 5G Camera & features \\n03:55 Lava Blaze 2 5G Other Features \\n05:15 Lava Blaze 2 5G Price \\n05:33 Lava Blaze 2 5G Our Opinion',\n",

We have unboxed many smartphones but since it's new year 2023 the redmi note 12 is our new guest here. We have a TPU case inside the box, sim ejector tool charger and the phone in the box. Post the redmi note 10 series we haven't covered the redmi note 11 series as the upgrade wasn't too big. But this time will check whether redmi note 12 5G is an upgrade or downgrade in a descriptive manner. This is a traditional design followed by every other brand nowadays. But while gripping it feels new and satisfying in terms of quality. It comes with the 33W fast charging support. Type C to USB charging cable. Followed by a quick glimpse of the drop test. Usually redmi is built quality would be good and this time the protection is carning Gorilla glass 3 protected from the front and the back is still plastic. It weighs 188g but the weight distribution is well balanced it feels flawless for us to hold it and use it even for longer while for daily use like chatting social media sliding etc. This 6.67 inch super AMOLED display is super smooth as the refresh rate is peaked at 120 Hz and 240Hz Touch sampling rate. The panel is very bright and vibrant as it has 100% dcip3 colour gamut. 1200nits peak brightness. In spite of AMOLED in place the side mounted fingerprint sensor is only embedded. face unlock is good too and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor is used this is a 5G supported processor which can simultaneously support 2 SIMs at the same time. And 5G ready is also available as both Airtel and Jio can be used alternatively at the same time on this phone. Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is a power efficiency processor. This is both on paper and on performance for better than the earlier note 10 processors. This is almost in power with Snapdragon 695 and a smooth in operation without much lag while gaming or other operations. 2 years of OS upgrade support and 4 years of security update support is offered is this phone with MIUI 13 and Android 12 combo. One might feel excited about this but this runs on Android 12 and most of the devices are already offering Android 13 hence you might not be able to experience more than 2 versions that won't be available. Security updates will be key as it's still the need of the hour. Hybrid SIM slot is not great but there are people loving a dedicated slot for added Memory. Performance wise the phone is really well enhanced with 8mp camera being the ultrawide sensor and 48mp being primary. Samples of photos from the primary sensor are better while the rest of the sensors including the selfie 13mp camera are decent. Instead of focusing in the numbers focus must be on optimization to win more hearts this is a slight slump. A single speaker is also a down side but still sounds good. But in 15k budget range the rivals are offering stereo. Almost an hour and half for charging the battery from 0% -100% for the 5000MAH. IP53 splash and dust resistance is offered as well. The IR blaster is a cherry on top of the cake. Dual band wifi and Bluetooth 5.1. \\n\\nReally this is an upgrade in terms of performance, AMOLED display power efficiency etc. Except for some slight slip in speakers and the camera is not a big upgrade.\\n\\nThat's all for today\\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A545G\\nhttps://TechBoss.openinapp.co/A345G\\n\\nSAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G & A34 5G\\n\\nWe plan to make this video in a sparking start with parallel unboxing of all the variants of both the phones. Here\\'s the Fun fact most sold series amongst the SAMSUNG phones is the A Series. When we unbox we would reveal not only the colours but also our general opinion on the same along with the design. Unboxing is very simple in terms of SAMSUNG as there is the phone at first followed by the SIM ejector tool TYPE C to TYPE C charging cable and papers that\\'s it. This A54 almost feels like a lookalike of S23 and is offered in 3 color variants out of which green looks great compared to the common blue and black. Quality its good while holding in hand as its a Midrange premium phone, as they used glass over plastic. we have the hybrid SIM slot. We have memory card option in this budget too which is nice. Display is good to view from any angle. This is a 6.4\" FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate, 1000 Nits Brightness. even if this peak 1000 Nits is felt less under red hot sun there is a feature names vision booster and SAMSUNG claims that even under heavy Sunlight, one can view very clearly. One might also ask if we view such brightness would n\\'t that be harmful to our eyes. Another reason for the better Multimedia experience we have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. And the SOC from A53 is slightly improved can you guess it. Here\\'s the clue, this is a 5nm Processor. If you don\\'t let me tell you. SAMSUNG Exynos 1380 processor. Hence games and be experienced only in medium settings with out lag even AnTuTu Score is slightly abpve 500k. This also holds a LPDDR4X RAM. This is launched as 2 variants 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. 5000mAh battery 25W fast charging support. We expect minimum 45W fast charging support, as 25W is too less for this budget range we hope SAMSUNG would address this in upcoming phones. Best appreciable factor that is inherited by other brands inspired by SAMSUNG is 5years of security updates & 4years of OS updates. Android 13 topped with One UI 5.1. We can expect updates upto Android 17. Unlocking speed is good and also the Face ID is good. SAMSUNG almost covered all the sensors for this budget. WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC Knox Security also we have IP67 rating and i believe this is alone in this budget range with this peotection. IP67 rating if to be explicitly mentioned, if immersed under fresh water for 1M depth for fresh water it would be safe  for 30 mins.This really works great. Camera setup is like 12MP Ultra Wide, 50MP with OIS support and 5MP macro unlike former 2MP. Punch hole selfie camera sensor is 32 MP main camera outputs are decent and good in color wise clarity wise satisfying. 4k 30fps recording is possible both on the fron and rear. But OIS is really very good in the 1080p 30fps recording relatively. Due to the availability of OIS even the night photography turns out to be very refined experience. There are few samples form the Night mode too. Single take, Night mode Food mode, panaroma, super slowmotion, slow motion, hyper lapse etc. also there is a mode called the Fun mode which sports a lot of filters that enhances the people experience who would like to make lot of their social media presence digitally we can enhance the overall quality of the photo. These are all the features of A54. While we jupm on to A34 we have a 6.6\" display FHD+ Super AMOLED display 120Hz refreshrate almost every thing\\'s the same. only instead of glass back we have plactic back here. Same battery is offered, Processor is Mediatek Dimensity 1080. Camera setup is like 8MP Ultra Wide, 48MP with OIS support and 5MP macro here too. Selfie completely transforms here as its 13 MP here, camera feature are same too. this too has the OIS support. there are very few mild changes A34 has been launched. In terms of pricing we wondered there would be a 6GB RAM variant but they lifted it up to minimum of 8 GB as base variant. 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Here A54 is priced at Rs 39k A34 is priced at Rs 33k. What do you feel about these phones for its budget. Well SAMSUNG claims that this shouldn\\'t be a performance oriented phone insteda this should be an allrounder every thing should be good instead. Hence all other features are not compromised and IP rating, enhanced camera setup. OIS support, OS and security updates if you are a SASUNG FAN we really need your feedback too. I\\'m done see you later.\\n\\nTime Stamp \\n*****\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:25 Samsung A54 Unboxing \\n00:57 Samsung A34 Unboxing \\n01:24 Samsung A54 First Impression\\n01:38 Samsung A54 Display \\n02:37 Samsung A54 Speaker \\n02:47 Samsung A54 processor \\n03:20 Samsung A54 Battery \\n03:30 Samsung A54 Software Update \\n03:49 Samsung A54 Special Features \\n05:10 Samsung A54 Camera \\n06:35 Samsung A34 Display \\n06:46 Samsung A34 Processor \\n06:51 Samsung A34 Camera \\n07:08 Price Details About Samsung A54 and A34',\n",

And explain the relationship of the BMW brand and the phone we are reviewing today. Because this review unit was shared with us in a high quality leather bag having red grey blue stripes resembling the BMW car stripes of the motor sport edition. As this phone is a dedication for the same. Even the texture of the box is great. We proudly would like to present the world's first ever  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip powered smart phone. With a super bole effect. Out of the box in the box are two phones similar in spec but different editions. iQOO 11 5G legend edition and apha edition. But I'm very much excited about the Legend edition hence would unbox this first. First flagship phone of 2023 iQOO 11. Feels really premium and design wise similar with the pattern followed since the 7 series. But the contrasting differences are here fiber glass and silicone leather is used at the rear of the phone. Hence it is also grippy and slip free. Since it's the BMW special edition it has the BMW M Motorsport there are some mini artifacts relating to the same. A best fit  TOU case is also a great deal but it overshades the Leather finish. With a 120W fast charger, 50% charge takes just 8 mins. Type C to Audio Jack converter. We add some comical portions to engage the audience. There are many cards featuring the features of these phones. Alpha edition is Matte finish and Ultra smooth. The rest in the box has the same contents as the Legend. iQOO is very specific about the best performance hence sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this time. Thermal management, GPU 20%, CPU 10% & power efficiency boost are the contrasting differences between two Generations. Usually every phone would have one dedicated chip perhaps this has 2. Yes V2 chip this has many pros but first is GAME FRAME INTERPOLATION this boosts the FPS yet makes it smooth. And a rich experience during game play. Low light image and video processing is top notch. On paper Antutu score is close to 1300k hence the fastest processor even supports hardware UFS 4.0 LPDDR5X RAM 24 GB RAM 16 is it's max with ram plus tech upto 8GB more is extended on another 8GB variant too same extension of 8 GB is offered all this is mostly exclusively for gaming. Not heating much because of the vapour chamber cooling panel. Best in performance really. This  sports a 2k E6 AMOLED panel 144Hz refresh rate and 1800nits peak brightness even best in sunlight.  Optimization of power based on requirement is handled best. Corning Gorilla glass victus. Other than this is an in display fingerprint sensor. Camera 13 telephoto, 8Mp ultra wide 8k 60 fps video shoot is available most resembling features to its early variants added this is V2 and selfie 16MP with peak of 1080p battery is bulged on capacity with 5000 Mah. Service is good enough as it's offered through Vivo centres. But in terms of the spare price, this is very less relatively when compared to that of its competitors who charge ₹20- 30k for display replacement but they promise less than ₹15k which is great in every other term. Being a sub brand of Vivo yet it feels like iQOO outperforms its parent brand. This phone is priced at ₹60k for 8GB 256GB & ₹65K for 12GB 256 GB variants. Everything is best still would you choose this for this budget.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#Under10kMobile #TechBoss \\n#Redmi12C  is available on Mi.com and Amazon from April 6\\n\\nLaunch Price (with bank offers)\\n\\n4GB + 64GB : 8,499*\\n6GB + 128GB : 10,499*\\nBuy Here:\\nhttps://amzn.to/3zmpOgN\\n\\nThis is the new budget friendly powerful smartphone up for release by Xiaomi. Let\\'s have a look at the phone. The box is traditionally Redmi style, the phone on the front of the box, features on the back. Slogans and titles on the side. SAR value for head is 0.88 & Body is 0.76 which is impressive. The phone looks really charming design wise. The fingerprint sensor on the back is close to the camera module this could\\'ve been slightly low but not a big deal. 10W Charger brick, Micro USB charging cable, SIM ejector and that\\'s it. This would be helpful as micro usb is still common among people who didn\\'t upgrade still and it\\'s still very common and more likely for peoples needs as claimed by Redmi. Actually the phone is heavy hence we\\'ll check it accurately, it\\'s 194g yes it\\'s obvious with a big battery, big display. But the main focus of this phone would be performance. Good performance in low budget is the key hence the Mediatek helio G85 is offered. In this budget range competitors are offering G35,37 even UNISOC processors. Compared to those this far ahead. Because even in gaming with low settings, we can experience smooth performance. It\\'s lag free in terms of daily use perspective. The phone is launched as 2 variants 7 GB & 11 GB including virtual RAM. 4GB 64GB AND 6GB 128GB are the actual RAM AND internal storage combo. In case if the memory is short the dedicated slot for the memory card is in place with support up to 1 TB. This is a 4G phone based on the processor i mentioned. The display is too large isn\\'t it? Yes it is. 6.71\"HD+ display with 500Nits peak brightness support. 120z touch sampling rate. 60Hz as usual. Chin and bezels are slightly bigger but the display isn\\'t shrunk hence it\\'s ok. The display is really vibrant and bright. There is a scratch resistant coating that is provisioned. It\\'s good as it works. The camera is a 50MP dual AI camera. Photo quality is good for this budget also compared to the contemporary competitors.  Video can be shot at 1080p. We\\'ll share the video samples and kindly check it out. It\\'s really decent for the budget given. The 5MP selfie is moderate too. Good enough for the basic use and video calling etc. For this price segment, we would get only the Google dialer, but here they offered the default Redmi dialer. I\\'m not sure how many of you realise but this is vital according to me. As the UI is friendly we can record calls on the go. The battery is a 5000mAh 10w charger with micro USB. A single speaker which is offered along with a 3.5 mm jack. IR blaster is missed out. The rear finger print sensor is fast, face unlock is fast as well. Besides we have IP52 rating which means splash resistance as if you go out while drizzling your phone is safe. This feature in this budget is offered only by Redmi and no other competitors. Dual band Wi-Fi is offered. MIUI 13 with Android 12 over it. They also claimed that the software and security updates would be there for sure. I\\'ll update it in the description soon as I know. Exactly I\\'m not sure of the price but the prediction is close to ₹8500. For me if the 4GB variant is launched for under 10k it would be, we are unsure if it\\'s introduction price or permanent. But if it  does, this would be a good pick as a daily driver, with good performance, big display with Mi dialer. See you soon.\\n---\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:09 Redmi 12 C Unboxing \\n00:55 Redmi 12 C First Impression \\n01:39 Redmi 12 C Display \\n02:13 Redmi 12 C Camera \\n02:43 Redmi 12 C Other Features \\n02:59 Redmi 12 C Battery \\n03:10 Redmi 12 C Special Features \\n03:48 Redmi 12 C Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Buy Here: https://rb.gy/77gfs\\n\\n#Agni2 #LavaAgni25G #ProudlyIndian #BestSmartphoneUnder25K #LavaAgni2 #AheadOftheCurve\\n\\nLave Agni 2 5g\\nLava Agni 2 5g comes with a hashtag which is “Ahead of the curve”. This is because the phone has got curve display. The packaging is quite nice. Box is similar to Agni 1, and there will be a lot of references to India on one side of the box. The unique feature of this phone is that if there is an issue in the phone when purchased, the company will send persons to your doorstep and change the phone. The device comes in a T view case. You are provided with a 66W charger along with Type-C 2.0 charging cable. The cable is quite impressive as the edges have been made in such a way that it does not get damaged. The phone does not have a headphone jack but has a converter. The model is slim and looks elegant. The phone not only looks elegant but has a good hardware also. The processor is MediaTek Dimensity 7050. Lava claims that it is introducing this in India for the first time. This is a good one for a phone which comes in the bracket of 20 to 22 thousand. The AnTuTu score comes to around 4 ½ lakhs. It is possible to play all the games in medium settings. To see that the device does not get heated it has a 2900mm square vapor chamber for good thermal performance. It is available in a single 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. It has no provision for a memory card, can support 2 sim cards only. The device supports 5g and has 13 5g band. The phone sports a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and also support HDR 10 / HDR+. It supports more than 1 billion colours with a 93.65% screen-to-body ratio. It also supports Widevine L1 certification. Display finger print sensor is another important feature. Display is protected by Schott Xensation glass. \\nThe handset comes with a quad-camera on the rear. The main camera has a 50MP primary sensor with a pixel size of 1µm. The second one includes 8MP ultra-wide unit, and the third and fourth cameras contains a 2MP macro snapper, a 2MP depth sensor. For selfie it is a bit small, it is just 16MP. Camera has got EIS support. For images it supports up to 2k, for videos it goes up to 4k. Clarity of photos are good, especially if you want to put them into social media. The colours are bright, and the edges do not get cut. There are a lot of modes which includes among others night mode, panorama mode, gif mode, beauty mode, slow motion, time lapse. It is possible to scan documents using intelligence camera. Selfie does not support 4k, you can only shoot with 1080p. \\nThe weight of this phone comes to 210 grams with the battery being only 4700mAH. Another interesting fact is within 16 minutes, half of the battery will get charged. This is one of the fast-charging phones in this price bracket. Vibration is good as the cell is made with X-Axis Linear Motor. This smartphone runs on Android 13.0 OS with no ads, no bloatware, and no unwanted notifications. It is fairly clean and this is something impressive. The company says it will provide OS updates for 2 years and 3 years of security update. You can also use a YouTube premier feature where the video will run even when you come out. This feature can be used without being a premium user. This is another feature that the company claims. \\nWhen you buy the phone, you can register in Agni Mitra’, wherein if you face any issue with Lava Agni 2, the brand will replace your device at your doorstep. No other brand can claim to do this. This is one of the efforts that Lava takes to satisfy its customers.  That Lava has given such a product is quite praiseworthy.\\nThe one drawback of this phone at first sight is that it does not have a stereo. There is only a single speaker. Other than this everything looks good for a phone which costs around 22 thousand rupees.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:33 Unboxing Lava Agni 2 \\n01:37 Lava Agni 2 First Impression \\n01:47 Lava Agni 2 Processor and Performance \\n02:13 Lava Agni 2 Storage \\n02:29 Lava Agni 2 Display \\n03:06 Lava Agni 2 Camera \\n04:24 Lava Agni 2 Other Features \\n05:47 Lava Agni 2 Our Opinion \\n\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

       "  'Description': '#Samsung #EpicStartsHere #GalaxyS23FE\\n\\nCheck Here:https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23-fe/buy/?cid=in_pd_social_facebook_galaxy-s23-fe_pre-buzz_samsung-s23-fe-Q3-2023_video-watchers_07oct2023_na-tech-boss-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\\n\\n\\nSamsung S23 FE. Here\\'s the all-new Samsung S23 FE which would bring lots of surprising elements on the go. We would proceed to unbox, as we have the mint color variant and purple likewise we have black as well. Such a simple unboxing open the box, un cover the phone and that\\'s it. Black variant sports greyish and the Mint green looks more premium as per our view. Most this resembles the S23 from the back. Not just this phone nowadays most of the Samsung phones looks the same as they want to maintain  it uniform across all budget ranges and also to give a little more perk for the users to enjoy premium flagship design. While holding, hope you remember A54 this is almost the replica or the closest match of the same. But the biggest difference is S23 FE uses Aluminum frame over the plastic frame in A54. Also, the overall holding quality feels better. Kindly share your views on the same while viewing. This has been a gap as after S21 FE only now skipping S22 FE we have the S23 FE hence the hype. Now we have 6.4\" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x Display with 120Hz Refresh Rate. Adaptive Refresh Rate is provisioned here and we lack LPTO panel here. In short, the Adaptive Refresh Rate means variable refresh rate based on different applications, like from least to most as we view image, browse, watch videos and play games etc. Major upgrade over here is the vision booster, peak brightness of 1450 Nits. Very bright as always, Samsung panels are usually good in quality. Only slight down side is the bezels and chin which is bit thick for the contemporary standards. Display protection offered is Gorilla Glass 5 even on the back. This sports a 4nm Processor its CPU, GPU, NPU all outperforms its Predecessors. Also, for the first time in FE, Ray Tracing is added which means better graphics and better gaming experience. We also have 3.9x larger vapor chamber cooling system. performance wise would be a killer as claimed by Samsung.  Samsungs own Exynos 2200 and camera feels like an upgrade with OIS and VDIS support makes it a great player. Maximum supported resolution is 8k at 24fps. Kindly refer the samples to decide up on. Night photography, night videography wise we feel there are clear improvements. Also, the assorted color outputs are here and feels pleasant. Wide angle is 12MP, Telephoto is 8MP and main is 50 MP. In short both low lit and day light condition are fair enough. Selfie in 21 FE was 12MP but here its 10MP but there is no quality compromise as we can notice stark difference in output generation. also, 4k 60fps support makes it a clear winner. 25W fast charging support, with wireless charging support and reverse wireless charging for accessories. Sports IP68 rating. Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC are added cherry to the cake. Knox security, wallet is available. One UI 5.1 over Android 13. Brand offers 4 & 5 years of OS & security updates respectively. Overall software experience is rich. available in 2 variants 8GB 128GB and 8GB 256GB priced at 60k and 65k including bank offers one can grab these for 50k and 55k respectively. Kindly share your opinion. We\\'ll catch you in the next one.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk',\n",

As we always lack the phones in this segment but samsung never failed to satisfy its audience with such expectations. We would like to keep it short instead of elongating. Firstly Latest Snapdragon Gen 2 is used besides it's also optimized specific to Galaxy devices. The Clock speed would be increased in short. usually the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 8+ Gen 2 would be over clocked and released as the new processor, but this time Samsung and Snapdragon collaborated to bring in an enhanced chip, hence compared to the other Brand Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor this would be a better option. Even for gaming the Ray Tracing is implemented with AI Adaptive Processing. For the first time in history, we have the vapour chamber cooling system in the S23 earlier we would have  the plus variant alone. So all the S23 variants would have the same hence there would be close to no issues related to performance. The Camera section is not a wopping upgrade its the same 50MP triple camera setup. But this time with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the ASP enhances the whole performance and processing of the images and the videos captured. In short, this would consider 3 parameters while capturing an image, 1. AI Object Aware Engine 2. AI Studio Depth Mapping 3. AI ASP algorithm based on this combo, the object identification, colour depth, and exposure will ensure the best quality photos are captured close to reality experiences are met. For example the Blur effects are very realistic. As per the samples we enclose you can share your thoughts, one can feel that the Portraits are really satisfying. Like wise 8K 30 FPS video recording is enabled through the rear camera. The details are really good and even the 4K 60 FPS quality is possible flawlessly. OIS and VDIS are improved beyond the earlier versions. Stability was outstanding really. Besides we do have features like Astro Photography, Expert RAW.We can click the RAW photos and edit as you wish. And the low light photography is wisely improved. Relatime noise reduction is really visually convincing. All these were already available but all of that is optimized. The selfie camera is really given a jump from 10MP to 12 MP, this not only clicks the normal photos well, but also performs better in terms of low light night conditions. Even during capture, this looks very dark. Besides this brings out better outputs. The samples would tell the truth. Design wise the Bump on the back around the camera from the previous variant is removed. One of the most striking fact is that the metal , glass and other materials used in the production of the phone are the recycled waste collected from the ocean. The Display is 6.1inches similar to the previous generation AMOLED 120Hz HDR10+ display. Ultra sonic fingerprint sensor is offered, this time the peak brightness is 1750 Nits which is as bright as the Sun. Even under hot sun we might not face any challenges in viewing the screen. Display protection is Corning Gorilla Victus 2. We will test the durability very soon for the same. Compact phones usually have a down side which is usually the battery. Hence the battery is 200MAH larger with 3900 MAH. 25watt fast-charging with wireless charging support. We believe it would last for at least a day with top spec, we aren't sure how long that would last. Android 13 over One UI 5.1 is offered. This would be extended to many more devices, this would sport 4 years of SW update & 5 Years of security update.  hence the Android update up to Android 17 could be expected. IP68 is the water resistance rating. It is priced at Rs 75,000 i believe that, S22 was released for 72,000 and S21 was for 70,000  so this has a hike of 3,000. FOr this if you would ask what better is here, the Processor with better clock speed, slightly improved camera and selfie camera, improved brightness, improved protection, slight upgrade to the battery. Even in a whole if, this looks like a slight upgrade over the previous variants, i feel that a phone as compact as this is the best. And there is possibly no other option in the market with a tough fight to this one. You let me know your views about, it in the comments section.I'll catch you in\\xa0the\\xa0next\\xa0one.\\n---------------------------------\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\",\n",

       "  'Description': '#GalaxyF14 5G  #Frevolution5G  #Samsung #FrevolutionPerformance  #FrevolutionPower #CollabWithSamsung\\n\\nGalaxy F14 5G sale starts on 30th March at 12 Noon\\n\\nBest Buy Link: https://www.flipkart.com/samsungf14-coming-soon-f2e-3f3e23-store?ocmpid=BrandAd_Samsung_F14_social_TechBoss_YT_video_cpc_sales\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy F14 unboxing\\nToday we are going to unbox the Samsung newly released Samsung Galaxy F14 not just buy me this time we include even Tariq bhai. We both have one phone with each one of us. We both are going to early unbox both these phones will say what we find in the box and what if you feel about the phone. How is that bro well this is fine. The one I have is good too. Recently released phones are in perfect sharp edges after a long time seeing blended edges feels different. So this is Samsung Galaxy F14. This phone is released in three colour variants BAE purple GOAT green and OMG black. I am holding the green bhai is having the purple. Other than this even black was released as you mentioned earlier. I am going to express the specifications of the phone and bhai is going to share his thoughts as a normal user regarding the same. How much do you guess it would be priced. 18 to 20k actually this is priced under 15k for the future it encloses. How do you feel the phone is for under 15k design wise. Well it feels good but why is that so heavy yes it weighs 206g well the reason is it holds a big fat 6000mah battery. So would the backup be close to do 3 days yes of course easily. Fast charging support of 25 Watts is offered but the charger is in there oh you can buy that separately. Besides this uses the Exynos 1330 is used. It\\'s a 5G processor is it ? Yes bro. How many bands does that support. 13 totally as claimed by Samsung. Also none of the competitors offer anywhere close to these many. That\\'s fine. How about gaming. That would be decent and also as per Antutu score is slightly above 400k. The hardware offered is relatively good. It has 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. And I believe the 6GB base variant is priced under 15k. If RAM isn\\'t enough what do you do. RAM boost technology right. Yes with up to 6 or 8 GB boost, we would be able to get a big RAM like 12 or 14 GB. The base variant itself is available with 128 gigs of internal storage. Do we have an option for external memory ? Yes, we can use two SIMs both with 5G and we have a dedicated slot for memory card as well. How\\'s the Display 6.6\"display with FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In this budget it\\'s really impressive. Everything is good but the bezels and water drop notch feels a little outdated. That\\'s correct but when the budget is less we can have a few less vital things getting compromised which is not affecting the quality or performance. Is the body plastic yes it is but is durable enough. Do we have Ultra wide camera. No boss no in this segment it has 50MP main camera sensor, alongside 2MP Macro. 13 MP selfie. We feel it\\'s good enough for the price range. The camera supports FHD 30fps then 60fps. No it doesn\\'t support it or even 4k. Decent camera for the budget range we cannot expect flagship in the entry level midrange smartphone. Let me ask you in general to share your views. When it comes to other brands then never ensure or promise years of security and OS update support yes they would never utter a word. But Samsung is wise in those terms, for this phone too they offer 2 years of OS upgrade and 4 years of security. This phone comes with Android 13 out of the box with One UI 5.1 over it. This has few special features too like the Knox Security for secure data, call screen as you might\\'ve noticed in my S22 and voice focus. Voice Focus is one of the vital features .This feature would be of help when you are in a noisy environment like traffic this would cancel the external noise and focus on the speakers voice. That\\'s available in the A34, S22, S23 series as well. They brought it to budget friendly phones too. Great. Don\\'t play the song we would have copyright issues. Then how would I check sound. Well you checked that before shooting right yes. How was it. It was good. This is a single speaker setup.  ohh isn\\'t that stereo. No. But the sound is still good. Overall kindly share your final thoughts for this budget. Generally if I am to buy a new smartphone for under 15000 budget what all would I expect a good battery we have it here good protection it\\'s there in place updates its also available finally 5G it\\'s available as well then for 15000 budget what else could we expect. Then what man it\\'s good. Let\\'s go then.\\n\\nTime Stamp\\n******************************\\n00:00 Intro \\n00:11 Unboxing Samsung F14 \\n00:55 Samsung Galaxy F14 Battery\\n01:16 Samsung Galaxy F14 Gaming and Performance \\n01:47 Samsung Galaxy F14 Display \\n02:18 Samsung Galaxy F14 Camera \\n02:50 Samsung Galaxy F14 Update \\n03:11 Samsung Galaxy F14 Special Features \\n03:40 Samsung Galaxy F14 Speaker \\n03:58 Samsung Galaxy F14 Our Experience',\n",

We would help one of our friends who will try to search for the others on a dark night. We would use the night photography advantage and improve the exposure of the photo and bring everyone to light. And guess what everyone is exposed. As the camera, blazes in the crowd. The outstanding camera and its night photography feature and upscaling of the exposure in dark takes it to the next level. And we would end the video in a cinematic way with suspense effect.\\n\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",

The box contains the phone, case, TWS, with SAMSUNG written on a mystery box and a small note about the S23 #ShareTheEpic. There’s a T-Shirt, Photo frame, a diary with  #ShareTheEpic on its front cover. Now comes the show’s stars S23, S23 Ultra, with 2 cases and a Galaxy Buds 2 PRO. S23 Ultra is then opened to show its outer cover printed with the phone’s back side. The phone’s boxy shaped design is praised when hold in hands, then its documents, charger, SIM ejector. The phone has 2 cases in different colours. The phone’s technical specifications are discussed with its upgraded storage to 256 GB, UFS 4.0 technology for butter smooth read and write actions. It has a 200 MP ISOCELL HM sensor OAS support which is a boon for media creators with an 8th Gen Snapdragon processor which helps in clicking exceptionally high quality images. A comparison with images capturing from an S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra are compared and also its 4K resolution @60 FPS is shown with a live side by side video to explain its image stabilisation. The compelling 12 MP front cameras quality is also discussed along its live camera switching during video recording which is again an exception among other android phones. There’s a sudden shift in light to dark mode which sports its high quality sensor showing night photography against an S22 Ultra. All the phone’s in this series use a Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 processor with abve 30% upgraded CPU, GPU, NPU performance, AI powered adaptive performance to increase it’s battery life and a high quality setting gaming with maximum graphics with less heat dissipation. Its boxy design is then discussed to speak about its bigger size, comfortable hold, 1750 nits brightness display which is even visible on a bright outdoor space. A CORNING GORILLA GLASS VICTUS 2 has been used. The software Android 13 powered by Samsung One UI 5.1, with upgrades for 4 years, that is upto Android 17 and 5 years of security patches. The expanded and louder Sound system is explained for media consumption and gaming. There is an S pen, 5000 mAh Battery with 45W fast charging, an IP68 rating. The phone can be explored more with its smart watch and earbuds series. The rate of the phone is about ₹1,24,999/- when Pre order comes with a Watch 4 and Buds 2 as a free compliment which is a steal deal. So the video ends by asking the viewers their verdict on the phone.\\n---\\nMedia Partner : Adada Creators\\nEmail : techboss@adadacreators.com\\n\\n😄 Subscribe😄 : http://bit.ly/2JmvIXb\\nYou can also follow me on:\\n📞 TeleGram: https://bit.ly/3dCwOJk\\n🌈 Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JkdyVI\\n🐦 Twitter: http://bit.ly/2xw0mZi\\n😊 Facebook: http://bit.ly/2sk5fPV',\n",
